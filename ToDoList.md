### TO DO LIST
- URMove
  - [X] Plot Path from CurrentPos to Target 
  - [X] Interpolate based on distance
  - [X] tweak acceleration/deacceleration to prevent sudden stops/jerks
  - [X] select correct Q Sol
  - [ ] remap to correct ranges/wrap to nearest joint position
- URKinematics
  - [X] figure out why the inverse is mirrored
  - [X] initial rotations on quaternion?
  - [ ] Joints to extend ofNode
- URTool
  - [ ] Create URTool class to manage the Toolpoint
  - [ ] create safe zone to prevent toolpoint from colliding with body.
- URWorkingZone
  - [X] Define a working zone and optimize movements to remain within that zone (Sort of done)
- Refactoring
  - [ ] Rename Toolpoint -> TCP & targetTCP
  - [ ] Remove redundant variables (e.g, targetPointPos -> tartgetTCP.position)
  - [ ] Synchronize world scalar for Mocap & Robot
- Release Prep
  - [ ] Example Project(s)
